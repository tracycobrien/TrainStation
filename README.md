# TrainStation

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporated Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Requirements

* App must have these basic requirements:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
    * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
     * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
  
     * Styling and theme 

### Added Functionality

    * Form Validation for correct time input
